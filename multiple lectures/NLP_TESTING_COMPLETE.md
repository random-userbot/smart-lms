## 📚 Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```python
from services.nlp import get_nlp_service

nlp = get_nlp_service()

# Complete analysis in one call
analysis = nlp.comprehensive_analysis(feedback_text)

# Access results
quality = analysis['quality_score']  # 0-100
sentiment = analysis['sentiment']['label']  # positive/negative/neutral
emotions = analysis['emotions']  # dict of 6 emotions
themes = analysis['themes']  # list of detected themes
keywords = analysis['keywords']  # top keywords
aspects = analysis['aspect_sentiment']  # per-aspect sentiment
```

### Dashboard Integration
```python
# Get all feedback for a lecture
feedbacks = get_lecture_feedbacks(lecture_id)

# Analyze batch
analyses = [nlp.comprehensive_analysis(f['text']) for f in feedbacks]

# Calculate metrics
avg_quality = sum(a['quality_score'] for a in analyses) / len(analyses)
sentiment_dist = Counter(a['sentiment']['label'] for a in analyses)

# Identify issues
confused = [a for a in analyses if a['emotions']['confusion'] > 0.3]
if confused:
    send_alert(f"{len(confused)} students are confused")
```
