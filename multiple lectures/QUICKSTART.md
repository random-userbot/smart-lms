# 🚀 Smart LMS - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Phase 1 Complete! 

I've successfully set up the foundation of your Smart LMS. Here's what's been implemented:

---

## 📁 What's Been Created

### 1. Project Structure
```
✅ /app/streamlit_app.py          - Main application with role-based dashboards
✅ /services/storage.py            - JSON storage service (DB-ready)
✅ /services/auth.py               - Secure authentication (bcrypt)
✅ /scripts/init_storage.py        - Initialize storage with sample data
✅ /config.yaml                    - Configuration file
✅ /requirements.txt               - All dependencies
✅ /run.bat & /run.sh              - Launch scripts
✅ /README.md                      - Comprehensive documentation
```

### 2. Core Features Implemented ✅

#### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- **Secure login** with bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- **Role-based access control**: Admin, Teacher, Student
- **Session management** with Streamlit
- **Registration system** for new users
- **Password change** and reset functionality

#### 🗄️ Storage System
- **JSON-based storage** (easy to migrate to PostgreSQL later)
- **Abstracted interface** - swap backend without changing code
- **Complete CRUD operations** for:
  - Users
  - Courses
  - Lectures
  - Engagement logs
  - Feedback
  - Grades
  - Teacher evaluations
  - Attendance
  - Teacher activity
  - Student progress

#### 🎨 User Interface
- **Modern Streamlit UI** with custom CSS
- **Role-specific dashboards**:
  - **Admin**: User management, system analytics, teacher evaluation
  - **Teacher**: Course management, content upload, student analytics
  - **Student**: Course enrollment, lecture viewing, progress tracking
- **Responsive design** with wide layout
- **Intuitive navigation** with sidebar menus

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
run.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 2. Activate it
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Initialize storage
python scripts\init_storage.py

# 5. Run app
streamlit run app\streamlit_app.py
```

---

## 🔑 Login Credentials

After running `init_storage.py`, use these credentials:

| Role | Username | Password |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Admin** | `admin` | `admin123` |
| **Teacher** | `dr_ramesh` | `teacher123` |
| **Student** | `demo_student` | `student123` |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (You can do now)

1. **Run the initialization:**
   ```bash
   python scripts\init_storage.py
   ```

2. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app\streamlit_app.py
   ```

3. **Test the features:**
   - Login as admin, teacher, and student
   - Explore the dashboards
   - Check that navigation works
   - Verify sample data is loaded

### Phase 2 (Next to implement)

I'll now create:
1. **Upload page** for teachers to upload lectures, PDFs, quizzes
2. **Quiz system** with auto-grading
3. **Assignment submission** interface
4. **Lecture player** page with video playback

Would you like me to continue with Phase 2 now?

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
# Storage paths
storage:
  base_path: "./storage"
  users: "./storage/users.json"
  # ... more paths

# Engagement tracking (for Phase 3)
engagement:
  mode: "realtime"  # or "offline"
  sampling_rate: 0.5

# NLP (for Phase 4)
nlp:
  sentiment_model: "vader"  # or "distilbert"
  bias_correction:
    enabled: true

# Teacher evaluation (for Phase 5)
evaluation:
  model: "xgboost"  # or "random_forest"
  shap:
    enabled: true

cd "c:\Users\revan\Downloads\multiple lectures\multiple lectures"

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Storage not initialized

## 💡 Tips

1. **Check the logs** - Streamlit shows errors in the browser
2. **Use the sidebar** - All navigation is in the sidebar
3. **Test with demo accounts** - Try all three roles
4. **Check storage files** - JSON files in `./storage/` directory
5. **Read the config** - `config.yaml` has all settings

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the **README.md** for detailed documentation
2. Review **config.yaml** for configuration options
3. Run `python scripts\init_storage.py` to reset data
4. Check that all directories exist (`storage/`, `app/`, `services/`)
